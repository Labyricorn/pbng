# Prompt Builder NG - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Prompt Builder NG is a modern web application designed to streamline the process of AI prompt engineering. It provides a visual interface for creating, managing, and composing prompts through a drag-and-drop interface, with support for dynamic field values, snippet management, and prompt composition tools. The application aims to help users create more effective prompts for AI systems by providing a structured, visual approach to prompt engineering.

## Problem Statement

AI prompt engineering is becoming increasingly important as large language models become more prevalent. However, creating effective prompts often involves:

1. Repetitive typing of similar prompt components
2. Difficulty managing and reusing prompt patterns
3. Lack of visual tools for prompt composition
4. Challenges in organizing and retrieving previously successful prompts
5. No easy way to parameterize prompts with dynamic values

Prompt Builder NG addresses these challenges by providing a visual, component-based approach to prompt engineering with robust management features.

## Target Users

- **AI Researchers** who need to test different prompt structures systematically
- **Content Creators** who regularly interact with AI tools
- **Developers** integrating AI capabilities into applications
- **Knowledge Workers** who use AI assistants for daily tasks
- **Prompt Engineers** who specialize in optimizing AI interactions

## User Stories

### Snippet Management

1. As a prompt engineer, I want to create reusable prompt snippets so that I don't have to retype common prompt patterns.
2. As a user, I want to categorize my snippets so that I can easily find them later.
3. As a user, I want to edit existing snippets so that I can improve them over time.
4. As a user, I want to delete snippets I no longer need so that my library stays organized.
5. As a user, I want to add dynamic field placeholders to my snippets so that I can customize them for different uses.
6. As a user, I want to search through my snippets so that I can quickly find relevant ones.

### Prompt Building

1. As a user, I want to drag and drop snippets to compose prompts so that I can visually arrange my prompt structure.
2. As a user, I want to click to add snippets to my prompt so that I have an alternative to drag-and-drop.
3. As a user, I want to edit field values in my composed prompt so that I can customize it for specific uses.
4. As a user, I want to preview my prompt in different formats (Markdown, JSON) so that I can see how it will appear in different contexts.
5. As a user, I want to clear my prompt builder so that I can start fresh when needed.
6. As a user, I want to copy my composed prompt to the clipboard so that I can easily use it elsewhere.

### Prompt Management

1. As a user, I want to save my composed prompts with titles so that I can reuse them later.
2. As a user, I want to browse my saved prompts so that I can find ones I've created previously.
3. As a user, I want to load saved prompts back into the builder so that I can modify them.
4. As a user, I want to delete prompts I no longer need so that my saved prompts stay organized.
5. As a user, I want to preview prompt content before loading it so that I can confirm it's the one I want.

### User Interface

1. As a user, I want a dark/light mode toggle so that I can use the app comfortably in different lighting conditions.
2. As a user, I want a responsive design so that I can use the app on different devices.
3. As a user, I want clear visual feedback for my actions so that I know when operations succeed or fail.
4. As a user, I want a clean, intuitive interface so that I can focus on prompt creation without distractions.
